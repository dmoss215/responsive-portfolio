        <p>My name is Dan Moss and I'm and aspiring web developer.  I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and I love this area.  I went to The Ohio State University and lived in Columbus, Ohio for five years.  I now live and work in northeast Ohio.
          <br>
          <br>
          I work in IT and enjoy pretty much everthing tech related.  I'm also a big fan of Cleveland sports.  I do like to get outside every now and then and enjoy snowboarding in the winter.  I don't have much else to say but I want to make sure my text is wrapping around my image so I am going to continue to type.  Hopefully this works.  Perhaps I'll change this later.  Perhaps not.
